Welcome to the DevOps SRE Daily Challenge!

Today, we dive into the fundamentals of DevOps vs. SRE,
exploring why DevOps is essential in the application release process,
the challenges it solves, and how SRE fits into this process.

Objective:
Your task today is to research and understand the following key aspects:
1. Why DevOps & SRE is needed in the application release process
2. The challenges DevOps & SRE solves
3. The tasks and responsibilities of a DevOps & SRE engineer

Think of DevOps and SRE as the superheroes of the software release process.
They help teams build, test, release, and maintain applications smoothly without running into delays, errors, or crashes.

Problems They Solve (In Simple Terms):
1. Slow & Painful Releases
ðŸ‘‰ Before DevOps, developers wrote code and "threw it over the wall" to the operations team, who then struggled to deploy it. This led to slow, error-prone releases.
âœ… DevOps fixes this by using automation (CI/CD) to test and deploy code quickly and safely.

2. Too Many Errors & Crashes
ðŸ‘‰ Imagine updating an app, and suddenly it crashes or stops working because of a tiny mistake.
âœ… SRE ensures reliability by testing, monitoring, and automatically fixing problems before users even notice.

3. No One Knows What's Wrong When Something Breaks
ðŸ‘‰ Without proper monitoring, teams have no idea why an app is slow or crashing.
âœ… SRE uses tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track everything and send alerts when something goes wrong.

4. Security Issues & Hacks
ðŸ‘‰ Without security checks, an app might have bugs or vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit.
âœ… DevSecOps (Security in DevOps) makes sure every update is scanned, tested, and secured before release.

5. Slow Fixes When Things Go Wrong
ðŸ‘‰ If an app goes down, fixing it can take hours or days without a proper plan.
âœ… SRE teams set up backup systems and quick recovery plans to reduce downtime.

6. Canâ€™t Handle Too Many Users
ðŸ‘‰ Imagine a shopping app crashing on Black Friday because too many people are using it.
âœ… DevOps uses scaling techniques (like Kubernetes and auto-scaling) to handle high traffic smoothly.

In Short:
DevOps speeds things up with automation.
SRE keeps things reliable with monitoring and quick fixes.


Both ensure apps work smoothly, securely, and without downtime.
